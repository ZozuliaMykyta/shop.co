I encountered some issues while trying to deploy the project. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to successfully deploy it at the moment. Despite following the necessary steps, I faced some challenges related to deployment configurations and hosting.

That being said, I am actively working on resolving the deployment process and plan to update the project once it's live.
